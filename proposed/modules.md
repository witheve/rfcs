# Modules

## Summary

In this RFC we present our idea for how modules work in Eve. Modularity has a spectrum of meanings, ranging anywhere from a collection of functions to package management systems. Modularity in this context refers to a collection of code that can be packaged, distributed, and referenced in other Eve programs to enable code reuse.

## Motivation

In order for Eve to succeed, Eve programs cannot exist in isolation. That is to say, Eve programmers should be able to leverage work done by the Eve community to accelerate the development of their own applications. To do this, programmers need a way to pull in the work of others into their own projects.
